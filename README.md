# ​ Object Detection System

A robust **Object Detection** project using state-of-the-art techniques like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN to detect and localize objects in images or video streams.

---

## Project Overview

This project implements object detection using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detectors. It processes images or video input to identify objects, outputting bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels.

---

## Features

- Supports detection of multiple object classes (e.g., people, vehicles, animals)
- Real-time inference on images, webcam, or video files
- Custom training using transfer learning
- Visual overlays with bounding boxes and labels
- Exportable results in formats like JSON, CSV, or Pascal VOC

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Pretrained Models**: YOLOv3/v5, SSD, Faster R-CNN (via Torchvision or similar)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib / OpenCV drawing functions  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and/or standalone Python scripts

---

## Dataset

Uses public datasets such as [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/) or [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), or a custom labeled dataset with an annotation format like YOLO `.txt`, VOC `.xml`, or COCO `.json`. Mention dataset size, annotation schema, and sample classes.

---

## Model Architecture

1. **Base Model**: Pretrained object detection architecture (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN)
2. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune on your dataset
3. **Training Pipeline**: Data augmentation, training loop, checkpointing
4. **Inference Pipeline**: Image/video input → preprocessing → detection → post-processing → visualization

## Project Structure

 ** Evaluation Metrics **
 1.Precision, Recall, F1-Score
 2.mAP@0.5, mAP@[0.5:0.95] (mean Average Precision) — particularly for COCO-style benchmarks
 3.Confusion matrix (where appropriate)

 
 ## Results & Visualizations
 1.Include output samples with bounding boxes on images/videos. For instance:
 2.Detected persons, cars in real-world images
 3.Performance plots: loss curves, mAP vs. epoch, precision–recall curves


 ## Future Enhancement ##
   * Support for additional detection architectures (e.g., YOLOv8, EfficientDet)
   * Real-time streaming detection using webcams or video feeds
   * Web deployment via Flask, FastAPI, or Docker
   * Multi-class semantic segmentation or instance segmentation models
   * Active learning: improve detector with user-annotated feedback
   * Integration with annotation tools like Roboflow or LabelImg
